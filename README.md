The primary purpose of this project is to help my client (an Pharmaceutical Company) prioritize the key market campaign message for the target segments, in order to improve the overall acceptance towards Covid-19 vaccine and to control the pandemic in the long term. To reach the goal, two analysis have been conducted: (1) to identify variables impacting people’s awareness and acceptance of both H1N1 and seasonal flu shot vaccination; (2)  to explore elements on people’s attitudes to wards Covid-19 vaccine through sentiment analysis of public posts on the target social media. 

The two RMD files are the final dashboards of the data analysis, presenting the insights from the data set through clear visualizations. The preliminary results based on the analysis present that certain demographic information including age, education background may impact people’s perception towards vaccines in general, and there is a positive trend in people's attitude towards Covid-19 Vaccine within the past few months.
